Project Title: Quantum Eavesdropper Detection in BB84

Project Description: This project explores Quantum Key Distribution through the perspective of the eavesdropper, Eve. It simulates two well-known attacks on the BB84 protocol– the Slutsky-Brandt attack and the intercept-resend attack– using Google Cirq. By comparing the effectiveness of these interception strategies, the project analyzes the vulnerabilities and limitations of BB84 in ensuring the secure transmission of a secret key.
